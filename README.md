# align_bismark_coverage
Align the COVERAGE files of multiple samples generated by BISMARK.

**NOTE:** BISMARK is a program for aligning bisulfite sequencing data to the reference genome to obtain the DNA methylation profiles for samples.

## How to use
Add two extra columns to each COVERAGE file by running the "addSC.r". The output files must have the extension name of ".cov".  
Run "align.sh" on these ".cov" files to align them.

**NOTE:** the scritp files contain details for running them.
